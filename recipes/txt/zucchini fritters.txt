Ingredients:
zucchini, grated/riced, 4 medium-sized (roughly 550 gms)
red onion, chopped, 1/2
Asian green chili, 2
cilantro, chopped, 1 handful
salt, to taste
garlic powder, 2 tsp
onion powder, 1 tsp
black pepper, 1/2 tsp
cayenne pepper, 3/4 tsp
egg, large, 2
almond meal, 50 gms
flax meal, 30 gms
mozzarella, 100 gms

Recipe:
Preheat the oven to 200C
Add some salt to the grated zucchini and leave it aside for 10 minutes. This will make sure that the zucchini will release water.
Now using a kitchen cloth, squeeze out as much water as possible out of the grated zucchini. This will take a while but its the most crucial step s have some patience mate.
From 550 gms of my grated zucchini I was left with just 300 gms after squeezing the water out (this will give you a fair idea).
Add the waterless zucchini to a separate bowl.
Add all other ingredients and mix it very well with your hands. Make sure everything binds together and a doughy mixture is formed.
Make some rectangular or circular shapes out the mixture and spread them on a baking tray.
Bake them for around 20-25 mins or until they are golden brown. You are all set :)
If you prefer you can even pan fry them.
